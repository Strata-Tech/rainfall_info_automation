Insurance company and offers protection against surge pricing on ride hailing companies (i.e Grab, Gojek,Ryde). Example of such insurance coverage provided is Droplets. https://www.droplet.sg/#/ . Such a plan protects commuters against unpredictable surge pricing on ride-hailing platforms when it rains.
Surge pricing, the practice of hiking up ride-hailing fares in times of high demand, usually kicks in when it rains.

There are 60 weather stations in Singapore which measures rainfall, and utilizing data from MSS (Meteorological Service Singapore) and calling a public API we can get real time feeds of rainfall at various locations
.
To aid insurance companies monitor whether claims are valid, or to do dynamic pricing, we will want to know whether is it raining now (0mm - no rainfall, >0mm - rainfall) and how heavy the rainfall is at various locations

How high will the surge pricing be (the heavier the rainfall, the higher the surge pricing)
In this project I automated the rainfall feeds which can further aid insurance companies to automate their pricing strategy?
